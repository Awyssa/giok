							When it comes to learning new things, re-reading notes is super boring and actually very ineffective at creating
							long-lasting memory connections in your brain.
						</p>
						<p>This means you can spend hours or even days reading notes, just to forget them within a week.</p>
						<p>
							Using active recall and spaced repetition is scientifically proven to not only increase how much you learn, but
							also help knowledge stick with you for much longer!
						</p>
						<p>
							This is why we built Giok! Giok, or 기억, is Korean for memory, and is an easy-to-use app designed to help you
							remember things quicker and retain them longer.
