A modern full-stack web application built to explore **Bun** and create a lightweight alternative to Next.js with complete end-to-end type safety.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project serves as a learning playground to:

- **Understand Bun**: Explore Bun's capabilities as a JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager
- **Build without Next.js**: Create a React-based SSR application with more control over the bundle and less framework overhead
- **Achieve Full-Stack Type Safety**: Implement end-to-end type safety from database to frontend
- **Modern Web Architecture**: Combine the best of SSR (for SEO) and SPA (for interactivity)

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a unique hybrid architecture that combines:

### Frontend Architecture

- **SSR Pages**: HTML pages with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for SEO-friendly, indexable content
- **React SPA**: Interactive application powered by [React 19](https://react.dev/) for dynamic features
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling

### Backend Architecture

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the core JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **API Framework**: [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) for type-safe API development
- **Database ORM**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for type-safe database operations _(planned)_
- **Server**: Custom routing with Bun's native `serve()` function

### Project Structure

```

## 🚀 Key Features

### Hybrid Routing System

- **`/`**: SSR pages for optimal SEO and initial page loads
- **`/app/*`**: React SPA for interactive features
- **`/api/*`**: Type-safe API powered by Elysia

### Development Experience

- **Hot Module Replacement**: Built-in HMR with Bun
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Fast Builds**: Leveraging Bun's native bundling capabilities
- **Tailwind Integration**: Bun plugin for seamless Tailwind compilation
